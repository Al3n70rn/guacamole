# Some of our tests require a human reference genome, which is too big to
# distribute. As a workaround we generate a "partial" fasta containing just the
# regions of the reference needed. We check in this partial fasta into the repo
# and it is used by the tests. The command here regenerates this fasta (change
# the FULL_FASTA_PATH appropriately).
