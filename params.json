{"name":"Guacamole","tagline":"Variant calling on Apache Spark","body":"### Variant Calling on the Hadoop Stack\r\n\r\nGuacamole is a framework for variant calling, i.e. identifying DNA mutations\r\nfrom [Next Generation Sequencing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing)\r\ndata. It currently includes a toy germline (non-cancer) variant caller as well\r\nas a somatic variant caller for finding cancer mutations.  Most development\r\neffort has gone into the somatic caller so far.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis is on a readable codebase that can be readily understood and\r\nadapted for experimentation.\r\n\r\nGuacamole is written in Scala using the [Apache\r\nSpark](http://spark.apache.org/) engine for distributed processing. It can run\r\non a single computer or on a Hadoop cluster. Guacamole reads BAM files and\r\ngenerates VCFs.\r\n\r\nGuacamole uses ideas and some functionality from\r\n[ADAM](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/adam). It also takes inspiration from\r\nthe [Avocado](https://github.com/bigdatagenomics/avocado) project.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n* [Github Repository](https://github.com/hammerlab/guacamole)\r\n* [Code Documentation](http://www.hammerlab.org/guacamole/docs/#org.bdgenomics.guacamole.package)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
